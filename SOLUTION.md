# Food Recipe

## Description

A simple flutter project with only the meal details screen aimed at understanding the basics of flutter and best practices involved in building flutter projects.

## Project Structure

The `libs` folder contains all flutter related codes. The project follows a component based approach breaking down reusable widgets as a standalone widget which can be found in the `widgets` folder. The `screens` folders contains the home screen and any other screen that will be added into the application.

Dummy data and models are stored inside the `data` and `models` folders respectively. The entry file for the application is the `main.dart` file.
